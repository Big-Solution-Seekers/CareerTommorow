### üöÄ Problem Statement

Clearly define the problem or challenge your project aims to address. Explain why this problem is important and how your project will provide a solution.

- Who the application's audience is
- What the application does for the user
- Why the user would use the application

_Example:_ Our application would mainly serve individuals with disability or mobility issues under financial or physical constraints. A priority would be those who live in underprivileged communities, conflict-affected areas, or communities with limited healthcare infrastructure. Our product will leverage the power of technology and community collaboration to make assistive devices more accessible and affordable to those in need. This is done by connecting individuals to a network of builders who facilitate the creation and distribution of affordable, 3D-printed devices.

### üìù Features & User Stories

- Describes all the features and their purpose.
- For each feature, outline the user flow.
- Identify features required for a MVP

Example:

- **User Profile Page (MVP)**: Users can sign into the application to see their home page. The home page will display all of their blog posts and settings for updating their profile.
- **Other User Profile Page (MVP)**: Users can see a directory of all users in the application. Clicking on their name will take the user to view the profile of that user.
- **Live Chat (MVP)**: Users can start a chat with another user. This chat will have live updates and all messages will be saved.
- **Chatbot (Stretch)**: Users can navigate to the `/chat` page to interact with a chatbot powered by ChatGPT.

### üìö Tech Stack:

Clearly state the technologies, frameworks, and tools you intend to use for the front-end and back-end development.

_Example:_ We intend on using React for the front end, Node.js and Express for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. We will also incorporate Socket.io to implement the live chat feature and ChatGPT to implement the chatbot feature.

### üóìÔ∏è Milestones and Timeline:

Break down the project into smaller milestones and outline a timeline for achieving them. Which features will you prioritize and by when will you complete them? Remember, you will have 5 weeks to complete this project. The first week will be spent planning and the remaining 4 will be spent building.

_Example:_

- By June 5: the MVP will be complete. Users will be able to post blogs and see them appear on their profile
- By June 15: the chat feature will be complete. Users will be able to chat with other users.
- By June 25: the chatbot powered by ChatGPT will be complete.
- By June 31: the final CSS styling will be applied.

### üíΩ Data Sources (if applicable):

If your project involves using specific data sources or APIs, mention them and explain how you plan to integrate them into your project.

_Example:_ This application will utilize the WeatherAPI API to retrieve live weather data based on the user's current location. We will use the WebLocation API to get the user's current location.

---

### ü§ù Team and Responsibilities (if applicable):

If you are working in a team, specify the roles and responsibilities of each team member and how you will collaborate throughout the project.

_Example:_ The team working on this project will consist of Ben Spector and Reuben Ogbonna. We will collaborate using Github Project boards to manage our tasks, Slack for communication, and Github to manage changes to the codebase. Reuben will primarily focus on building the blog feature while Ben will focus on building the live chat feature.
