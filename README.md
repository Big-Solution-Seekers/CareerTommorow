## üòû The Problem

<!-- content goes below -->

A college education is very financially demanding and can make low-income students victims of debt, with an especially disproportionate burden on Black and Latino borrowers (California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, 2023). As a result, those unable to afford college may face limited opportunities and struggle to build a successful career. According to Forbes, the average income for non-college graduates is about $30,000 per year, significantly lower than that of college graduates (Tamplin, 2024). This disparity becomes even more apparent when these students apply for jobs, as they may not meet the qualifications due to a lack of access to the same educational opportunities as their peers. This lack of college education often prevents career starts and limits their upward mobility, making it difficult to escape low-paying jobs (Whistle, 2023).

## üìù Summary

<!-- content goes below -->

Research shows that unfortunately, race correlates to income. This is a major factor in why students of color leave college with high levels of debt. In "Why Student Loan Debt Harms Low-Income Students the Most," Maggie Thompson explains that low-income students borrow more and are more likely to default due to limited support, lower graduation rates, and poor job prospects. This debt burden hinders their financial independence and perpetuates poverty. The article calls for reforms like increased grants, income-driven repayment plans, and reduced education costs (Thompson, 2016). This results in a higher likelihood of earning low salaries in the future. Research shows that ‚Äú High school graduates earn an average of $746 per week, or $38,792 annually, and lower their risk of unemployment to 3.7 percent‚Äù and ‚ÄúIndividuals who have completed some college courses but did not graduate earn an average of $833 per week or $43,316 annually. This group of students has an average unemployment rate of 3.3 percent.‚Äù (Stobierski, 2022) This highlights the difficult reality of having limited options because of the financial constraints a higher education can create.

## üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Key Technical Challenge

<!-- content goes below -->

- Protecting sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords, during account creation. To address this, we plan to implement strong authentication and authorization processes. By prioritizing these security measures, we aim to safeguard our users' information and create a safer environment within our app.

- React Hooks - Handling user inputs and page navigation using React Hooks, presents a significant challenge. To tackle this, we are focusing on using React‚Äôs tools effectively to control data flow, ensuring smooth content changes when users interact with forms or navigate different sections of the site. This approach helps us capture user interactions accurately and provides a smooth and responsive user experience.

- Implementing the search and filtering functionality ensuring the user gets the best results based on cost, duration, field of study, and location. This is a challenge because as the number of filters increases, database queries become more complex in the backend part of the application.
